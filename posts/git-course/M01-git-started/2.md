# By default Eleventy will create the url /posts/2023-02-10 which looks wierd
# We also can't let it use the title or slugify as that would be a huge title
# So this is the correct way to provide urls if you want to have clean urls

### Introduction to Version Control Systems

A version control system (VCS) is a software tool that helps developers track and manage changes to source code over time. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, and helps to resolve conflicts that may arise when different versions of the code are merged together. Version control systems are an essential part of the software development process, and are used by developers and teams of all sizes.

There are several types of version control systems, including centralized version control systems (CVCS) and distributed version control systems (DVCS). In a centralized version control system, a central repository stores all versions of the code, and developers must communicate with the repository to check out code, make changes, and check in code. In a distributed version control system, each developer has a copy of the entire repository on their own computer, and changes are synced between the copies.

### How Version Control Systems Differ from File Backups

While version control systems and file backups may seem similar at first glance, they serve different purposes and have different features. Some key differences between version control systems and file backups include:

- Purpose: The primary purpose of a version control system is to track and manage changes to source code over time. File backups, on the other hand, are designed to create copies of important files and store them in a separate location for safekeeping.
- Version history: A version control system maintains a complete history of all changes made to the codebase, including who made the changes, when they were made, and why. File backups, on the other hand, typically only create copies of the most recent version of the files.
- Collaboration: Version control systems are designed to support collaboration between multiple developers working on the same codebase. File backups, on the other hand, do not have this capability.
- Merging: In a version control system, developers can merge different versions of the code together to create a unified version. File backups do not have this capability.

### Conclusion

Version control systems and file backups are both important tools for managing and protecting important files. However, they serve different purposes and have different features. While file backups are essential for creating copies of important files for safekeeping, version control systems are essential for tracking and managing changes to source code over time. Understanding the differences between these two tools can help you choose the right tool for your needs.
