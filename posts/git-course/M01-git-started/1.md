# By default Eleventy will create the url /posts/2023-02-10 which looks wierd
# We also can't let it use the title or slugify as that would be a huge title
# So this is the correct way to provide urls if you want to have clean urls

Welcome to our Git course! In this course, you will learn how to use Git to track and manage changes to your source code projects.

### do you think the above curriculum would provide value to someone who is learning git

I believe the above curriculum would provide value to someone who is learning Git, as it covers a wide range of topics and best practices for using Git effectively. The curriculum covers everything from setting up Git and creating a repository, to collaborating with Git and using advanced features such as cherry-picking and hooks.

Additionally, the curriculum includes a chapter on Git best practices, which can help learners understand how to use Git effectively in a team environment and avoid common mistakes. The bonus chapter on Visual Studio Code tips is also useful for those who plan to use VS Code as their primary Git interface.

Overall, I believe the above curriculum provides a comprehensive overview of Git and how to use it effectively, and would be a valuable resource for anyone learning Git.

But before we dive into the details, let's take a moment to discuss what Git is and why it is important.

### What is Git?

Git is a way that we can keep track of changes to a project. Imagine you're working on a drawing with your friends, and you all take turns adding to it. Git helps us keep track of who added what, so we can remember all of the different changes that were made. It's kind of like a history book for our project.

Git is a version control system that is used by developers to track and manage changes to source code over time. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, and helps to resolve conflicts that may arise when different versions of the code are merged together. Git is an essential tool for any software developer, and is used by teams of all sizes to manage and collaborate on code projects.

Sure! Let's say you and your friends are working on a puzzle together. You might take turns adding pieces to the puzzle, and at any given time, the puzzle might look a little bit different. Git helps us keep track of all of the different changes that were made to the puzzle, so we know who added what and when.

Imagine that you have a camera, and every time someone adds a piece to the puzzle, you take a picture. You would then use Git to keep all of these pictures organized, so you can look back and see how the puzzle looked at different times.

Git is also a little bit like a game of "telephone," where one person whispers a message to the next person, and so on, until the message gets passed all the way down the line. Git helps us keep track of all the different messages, so we know what was said at each step along the way.

I hope these examples help! Do you have any other questions about Git?

### Why is Git Important?

Git is important for several reasons:

- Collaboration: Git allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, and makes it easy to merge their changes together. This makes it easier for teams to collaborate on code projects, and can help to speed up the development process.
- Version history: Git maintains a complete history of all changes made to the codebase, including who made the changes, when they were made, and why. This history is an important tool for understanding the evolution of the codebase, and can be used to identify and revert changes that may have caused problems.
- Reproducibility: Git makes it easy to reproduce past versions of the codebase, which can be helpful for debugging and testing.

### Why Do I Need It?

As a software developer, Git is an essential tool that will help you to manage and collaborate on code projects. It is used by developers and teams of all sizes, and is an important part of the software development process. By learning how to use Git, you will be able to track and manage changes to your code projects more effectively, and collaborate more easily with other developers.

### Why is it Essential to Software Engineers?

As a software engineer, Git is essential because it allows you to track and manage changes to your code projects in a more organized and efficient way. It helps you to collaborate with other developers, and makes it easier to resolve conflicts when working on the same codebase. Git is also an important tool for maintaining a complete history of the changes made to the codebase, which can be helpful for debugging and testing.

Git is essential for software engineers because it allows them to track and manage changes to their codebase. When working on a software project, it's common for multiple people to be working on the same code at the same time. Git helps these people collaborate by allowing them to easily share and merge their changes with each other.

Git also helps software engineers track the history of their codebase, which is especially useful when they need to go back and find an old version of their code or identify when and where a bug was introduced.

In short, Git is an essential tool that helps software engineers work together and manage their code more effectively.

### Difference with Github

Git and GitHub are often used interchangeably, but they are actually two different things. Git is a version control system that is used to track and manage changes to source code. GitHub is a web-based platform that is built on top of Git, and provides features such as code hosting, bug tracking, and project management.

In other words, Git is a tool that is used to manage code, while GitHub is a platform that provides additional tools and services for developers.

### Overview of the Git Workflow:

Now that we have a basic understanding of what Git is and why it is important, let's take a look at the basic Git workflow.

The Git workflow consists of three main stages:

1. Working Directory: This is where you make changes to the codebase.
2. Staging Area: This is where you prepare your changes for commit.
3. Repository: This is where the committed changes are stored.

At each stage of the workflow, you use Git commands to track and manage your changes. In this course, we will cover these commands in detail, and show you how to use them to effectively manage your code projects with Git.

So that's it for our introduction to Git. In the next lesson, we will dive into the details of how to install and set up Git on your system.
