# By default Eleventy will create the url /posts/2023-02-10 which looks wierd
# We also can't let it use the title or slugify as that would be a huge title
# So this is the correct way to provide urls if you want to have clean urls

### Configuring your Git user name and email

When you use Git to track and manage changes to your source code projects, it is important to properly configure your user name and email address. This helps to identify you as the author of the changes you make, and ensures that your contributions are properly attributed. In this article, we will walk through the steps for configuring your Git user name and email on a Windows, Mac, or Linux operating system.

### Why Configure Your Git User Name and Email?

Your Git user name and email are used to identify you as the author of the changes you make to your source code projects. When you commit changes to a Git repository, your user name and email are recorded in the commit message along with a summary of the changes you made. This helps other developers who are working on the same codebase to understand who made the changes, and why.

In addition, your user name and email are used to generate your Git commit history, which is a record of all the changes you have made to the codebase over time. This history is an important tool for understanding the evolution of the codebase, and can be used to identify and revert changes that may have caused problems.

### Steps to Configure Your Git User Name and Email:

To configure your Git user name and email, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Enter the following command to configure your user name: **`git config --global user.name "Your Name"`** (replace "Your Name" with your actual name).
3. Enter the following command to configure your email address: **`git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`** (replace "**[your.email@example.com](mailto:your.email@example.com)**" with your actual email address).
4. Press Enter to run each command.

### Verifying Your Configuration:

To verify that your Git user name and email have been properly configured, you can run the following command in a terminal window: **`git config --global --list`**. This will display a list of all the configuration settings for your Git installation, including your user name and email.

### Conclusion:

Configuring your Git user name and email is an important step in the process of using Git to track and manage changes to your source code projects. By properly configuring your user name and email, you can ensure that your contributions are properly attributed and that your commit history is accurate. The process for configuring your user name and email is simple and can be completed in just a few steps.
