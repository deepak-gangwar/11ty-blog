# 11ty developer blog ðŸ‘»

This is my personal developer blog where I document my learning journey and also hope to help others.

- The site is built using 11ty as the Static Site Generator (SSG)
- Content comes form markdown posts as well as from Sanity CMS.
- Nunjucks is used as the templating language.
